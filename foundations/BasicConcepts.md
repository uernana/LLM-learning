1. Topics:

+ Scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors

+ Matrix multiplication

+ Dot product (important for attention!)

+ Norms & cosine similarity

+ Eigenvalues/eigenvectors (intuition only)

2. Exercises:

+ Compute dot products manually.

+ Write a function in Python to compute cosine similarity.

+ Visualize a vector projection in 2D.

3. Mini Quiz:

+ What is the shape of matrix multiplication A(m×n) × B(n×k)?

+ Why is dot product important in attention mechanisms?
